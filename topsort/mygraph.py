        Some notes about implementation:
        1) We implement the adjacency matrix not as an actual 2D array,
        but as a hash table of hash tables (in PythonSpeak, a dictionary
        of dictionaries). There are four main reasons for this:
            a) the code is cleaner; with a true 2D array there's a lot of bookkeeping to do
            b) it's more \"pythonesque\"
            c) 2D arrays would have to be of a fixed size unless you want to add a lot of ugly code
            d) it has the same big-O runtime for access, insertion, etc.
        2) Python is _wonderful_ about the decorator pattern. Just assign a tag somewhere
        in your program, like edge.toVertex = blah, and you've got your decorator.
        3) Instead of storing the edges and vertices in some sort of linked list, we use a
        cleaner implementation: a set (which is basically a dictionary without the values).
        This makes perfect sense considering the mathematical representation of a graph
        (and has the same big-O time as a linked list for the operations we need:
        insertion is O(1), iteration is O(n)).
        4) insertVertex() and insertEdge() actually take _vertices_ and _edges_
        as arguments, not elements from which vertices and edges are created. This allows
        you to have a vertex or edge in more than one graph (and you don't need to make
        them have the same connections in both graphs; it's just like the mathematical
        idealization of a graph)."""
